# Databases Project - 2019
Assessment project for the course "Databases" of 4th semester, Department of Informatics - University of Piraeus.

In this project, I had to create a database for a e-ticketing aplication in PostgreSQL. First, I created the data from mockaroo and then applied the 3NF normilisation. I wrote some basic queries and I implemented triggers and cursors. Finally, I created a simple console application in java in order to execute those queries.
